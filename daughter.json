    "devotion": "The greatest thing that we can pray for our daughters is that they will be eternally satisfied in God. At his right hand is where pleasure is to be found, and in his presence alone fullness of joy is to be found; for our daughters to drink from any other fountain will only multiply her sorrows (Psalm 16:4). Therefore, we must pray that our daughters find their deepest satisfaction in God.",
    "prayer": "Father, I pray that you would cause my daughter to find her deepest satisfaction in You. Rescue her from looking to other things to find satisfaction and pleasures. Help me to lead her in my enjoyment of You. At your right hand is where joy is found. Help us to truly believe this and live accordingly. In Jesus' name, Amen.",

    "devotion": "Our daughters are faced with so many promises about what will make them happy: toys, clothes, trophies, parties, and beauty. All of these and more are said to fill them with happiness. Yet, these toys end up under the bed, clothes go out of fashion, and trophies gather dust in the garage. Only through Jesus can our daughters have real joy. They are torn in a culture that celebrates excessive partying and also revels in the dark side of depression and angst. So too, girls fluctuate between naiÌˆve giddiness and moody gloominess. God's desire is that they find joy, not just happiness, in their relationship with him. His desire is that our greatest joy comes from salvation in him in in others finding that salvation. Only God will help them get off the roller coaster and find enduring peace and joy in the presence of the Lord.",
    "prayer": "Jesus, our Prince of Peace, I pray that you would fill my daughter with your joy, a deep and abiding joy that persists in the best and worst of times. I pray that you would make her certain of her salvation and determined to invite other to know you as well. Please give her eyes that see through the vain and hollow promises of worldly happiness to the truth of being whole and satisfied in you. Surround her with godly boys and girls who will seek to encourage and build her up in the joy that you offer. Let her be a wellspring of joy in the lives of others as well. Remind me also to seek God's joy, not the toys of the world, as an example to her.",

    "devotion": "Whether your daughter is young or old, there are many things in her life competing for her time, talents, affection, and worship. So much of her energy can be wasted on the wrong things that this world has to offer. Even good things, that the Lord created to point us to praise for Him, can become bigger than they should. Let's pray for our daughters to flee from idolatry and into the arms of Jesus--the only one who can satisfy her heart.",
    "prayer": "Magnify yourself, Lord, in my daughter's heart. Draw her to you and pursue her with your unfailing love. I pray that she will see that any joy and pleasure in this life is nothing compared to what you offer and is only meant to point her to you. Help her to see you working in her life and to praise you, even if it hurts, while she is struggling with following after your will versus hers. Holy Spirit, please empower her to praise you at all times. Lord, help her to worship you, the Creator, over your good creation.",

    "devotion": "As our daughters grow, their hearts will attempt to lead them astray and turn their attention and affection toward themselves. They will struggle with the urge to keep their eyes locked on Christ, wanting to receive glory instead of give it. Yet God tells us that our joy is complete in Christ. When we've loosened our grip on all that we are and all that we have, we will find the love and identity that we once sought by trying to raise ourselves to higher heights. Decreasing gives way for Christ to enter. Let us pray that our daughters will become less.",
    "prayer": "Lord, thank you that our glory is not dependent upon ourselves. I pray that my daughter would know that she doesn't need to look to herself for joy, but that all she searches for has been purchased for her by your sacrifice. Help me to model this joy that is found in giving all to you and in dying to myself. May she desire your glory more than this world, and find her life in you alone. Keep her eyes fixed on you. Thank you for chasing after her heart. Amen.",

    "devotion": "Language is beautiful. We often use language to create images that catch our attention or communicate in a vivid way. For instance, in this prayer we focus on our daughter's hands. Those hands represent the whole posture of her life. We want to see our daughters serve Christ. Every time I look at my daughter's little hands I am reminded of Christ. When she whispers to her brother, \"Let me do that for you,\" or when she giggles as she gets a utensil for mommy out of the kitchen door, I rejoice as I watch her little hands serve. Though she is young and only beginning to understand the posture of service, she delights in the Lord's work.",
    "prayer": "Lord, I pray that my daughter will not serve to get served in return. I pray that she will discover that she serves others as she serves Christ. Fill her heart with eagerness to serve. Ready her hands for selfless effort. May those little hands get most excited about embracing You, her Father in Heaven, with the same fierceness that they embrace her daddy on earth.",

    "devotion": "\"Pink! Pink! Pink! Why is everything Barbie so pink!?!\"\n\nI can still picture our youngest daughter who, at age five, spoke these words with such comical earnestness that my husband and I still chuckle when we repeat them - now some twenty years later. Why, indeed, is everything Barbie so over-the-top pink and frilly and ridiculously \"feminine\"? And how is it that at least three generations of American girls have had their ideas of beauty so universally influenced by an eleven inch molded piece of plastic? Young women compare themselves to Photoshopped images of celebrities with personal trainers, and mature women wince at their HD images when they take that FaceTime call from their grandchildren. May our daughters be set free from such things as they grow in godly beauty from the inside outward.",
    "prayer": "Heavenly Father, you made all things with beauty in mind. Today, I pray that my daughter would know and accept that her true beauty comes from knowing you. Lord Jesus, remind her even now that youth and outward beauty will fade with time, but true beauty only grows as the years pass. Encourage her to cultivate that beauty, to spend time in your Word, in prayer, and with other spiritually beautiful women. May she compare herself only to the standard of your holy Word, and may the only thing she finds repulsive be the ugliness of sin. Lord, grant her grace to develop the true loveliness that comes only from you.",

    "passage": "I entreat Euodia and I entreat Syntyche to agree in the Lord.\nPhilippians 4:2",
    "devotion": "Sisters have a truly unique kind of relationship with their siblings. In his good creation, God made women with an amazing and deep capacity for relationship; this is never more so on display than within the family of the local church. Here, Christian women become sisters of numerous brothers and sisters, both older and younger, playing an integral role in the unity and health of the local church body. However, for as long as we are still battling that abiding sin nature, relationships will also have the potential for argument, hurt, resentment and gossip. Let us pray that God will help our daughters to be supportive and encouraging sisters who are united by a love for Christ and his church and who refuse to be divided by petty differences.",
    "prayer": "Father, I am in wonder of the way you have created women, and I praise you for their unique gifts in creating and fostering relationships. Thank you for using them to strengthen and grow your church! I ask that you would bless my daughter with the grace and abundant love to use her gifts for the unity of the church, speaking words of wisdom and peace, avoiding all manner of back-biting, bitterness and gossip.\n\nPlease help my daughter to be a loving sister for the advancement of the church, to the glory of Jesus Christ our Lord.

    "devotion": "Our world is consumed with the pursuit of things. Our culture values wealth and prosperity, brand names and big cars, large houses and large living. Money is a constant draw on the hearts of many, and our daughters are not immune. She will contend with the idols of this land, whether she has little or much. She, like we, cannot serve God and money. (Matt. 6:24)",
    "prayer": "Oh God, protect the heart of my daughter from the idols of money and prosperity. Guard her desires and keep her content with what you provide, not with what the world says she should have. Do not give her so much that she forgets you, or so little",

Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.\nHebrews 4:15-16",
    "devotion": "As a parent, I've tried to reassure my daughter that she can come to me about anything. I want her to be confident that my love for her will not waiver. How much more should I desire her to draw near to her Heavenly Father? As a child of God, she can be confident that he will receive her. She doesn't come to him on the strength of her record but on the perfect record of Jesus Christ.",
    "prayer": "Father, I thank you for saving my daughter. I thank you she can draw near to you, not in the hope that her good deeds outweigh the bad, but because of Jesus. He has taken her record of wrongs on the cross and has transferred his record of righteousness to her. May she hold fast to this truth when she is struggling with sin and discouraged with her Christian walk. I pray the gospel will be louder and clearer than the voices that tell her she needs to try harder and do better before she can come to You. May she run to your throne of grace with confidence, knowing that grace and mercy flow freely to your children. In Jesus' Name, Amen.",

    "devotion": "My oldest daughter is our big helper; she's always quick to help when asked, and wants to do whatever she can to please us. But as you can imagine, this has a dark side. When she knows we're disappointed in something she's done, it crushes her. A stern look can send her into tears. As nice as it is that she wants us to be happy with her behavior, I want my little girl to see that pleasing us isn't the point. If we were trying to please people, we wouldn't be servants of Christ (Gal. 1:10). Instead, we live to please Christ-and this is something we can do only when we're relying on His righteousness.",
    "prayer": "Father, thank you for reminding us our \"goodness\" is never good enough-that we must always rely on Christ's perfect righteousness to stand before you. I pray my daughter's desire would be to please you before anyone else, that all she does would be to bring glory to your name, and she would do this first as foremost by trusting in the gospel. Amen.",

    "title": "she would place her life in the care of the Almighty",
    "passage": "And who knows whether you have not come to the kingdom for such a time as this?\nEsther 4:14b",
    "devotion": "Esther became a woman of notoriety during a tumultuous time in Israel. She did not choose it, and in fact, initially shrank back from it. Yet in the end, rather than seeing herself as a mere victim of circumstance, she placed her life in the care of God Almighty and stepped into history with her eyes set firmly on him. Rather than use her beauty and intelligence for her own gain, she trusted God with the very blessings he had given her and secured the salvation of many by her faith and willing obedience.",
    "prayer": "Heavenly Father, we cannot control the course of history or choose the times into which our daughters are born. We can and must, however, choose to entrust our daughters to you \"for such a time as this.\" Lord, we ask that you would give them wisdom. We ask that you would enable them to use the gifts you have bestowed upon them for your glory. Make them confident in you and bold to obey you. And may they, by this obedience, bring the hope of the gospel to many.",

    "title": "Christ would heal her wounds",
    "passage": "He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.\nPsalm 147:3",
    "devotion": "We prayed this same thing for our wives and for our sons in those respective challenges. We live in a culture filled with wounded and broken people. Sometimes broken because of their own rebellion; sometimes broken because of the rebellion of someone else. God heals up the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds. No matter their age, our daughters likely carry with them wounds; some emotional, some physical, others mental or spiritual. Christ is redeeming this brokenness. Whatever wound your daughter is carrying, pray today that Jesus would give her healing. No wound is too deep for Christ to fill up with his goodness and mercy.",
    "prayer": "Father, I am grateful that you heal the brokenhearted and bind up our wounds. Lord, I know that my daughter has wounds. It pains me to think that some of them are there from my own sin. I also know that praying for her healing might mean that you have to reopen the wounds to give her redemption in these areas. Heal the places in her heart that are broken. Bind up her wounds. Overwhelm her with your grace and mercy. Where there were once ashes, replace them with your beauty. Amen.",

    "passage": "Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.\nIsaiah 6:8",
    "devotion": "Too often we are prone to go with the flow; following the crowd and trying our best to fit in. Jesus' call to us is to follow him no matter how we may be perceived or treated. This can be terrifying for us, especially for the young. We live in an age of conformity where our fashion, our music, our trends must conform to social norms or we are seen as odd. It takes great courage to step out in faith to live radically different for God. Even parents have a hard time allowing their kids to choose ministry over sports and academics, to choose missions over careers, and to choose to stand apart rather than fit in. Our daughters need courage and vision to stand up and step out for the sake of the Gospel.",
    "prayer": "Lord, I pray for my daughter, that you would inspire her, fill her with your Holy Spirit and empower her to stand up before you and say, \"Here am I, send me.\" I pray that you equip her and surround her with your church so that she is well prepared to do the good works that you have prepared for her to do. Lead her, teach her, and live through her in every way that will bring you glory. Give her the humility and courage to decide that standing up for her faith and following you is more important than fitting in and being liked. Comfort her when she is persecuted, strengthen her when she is weak, and protect her from the attacks of the enemy.",

    "passage": "\"Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.\" This mystery is profound, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church. However, let each one of you love his wife as himself, and let the wife see that she respects her husband.\nEphesians 5:25-33",
    "devotion": "Parents (Dare I say it? Especially fathers!) feel an incredible need to protect, cherish and guard over our daughters. One of the scariest moments we face in life is entrusting the care and provision for our daughter into the hands of another man. After all, who could possible measure up to our standards, right? And yet, there is no joy like knowing that your daughter has found a man who is dedicated to loving her in a Christ-like manner, devoting himself to her care and wellbeing. This is something that we should be praying for our daughters of any age - newborn, teenager, or adult! One of the greatest blessings our daughter can find in this life is a man who will love her like Christ loved the church.",
    "prayer": "Father, it's never easy for me to admit that I really have no control of my own over my daughter's life. Her days are completely in your hands, as much in her marriage as in her health, growth and salvation. So I pray to you, the source and giver of every good gift, that you would provide my daughter with a godly man for a husband: a man who loves Christ first and won't idolize her; a man who loves her so much more than himself; a man who will wash her with your word and cherish her every day. Please bless her with the wisdom to trust in you to provide such a man, if you so choose, and to not settle for anything less. Amen.",

    "passage": "And he made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their dwelling place...\nActs 17:26",
    "devotion": "Our younger daughter is our little go-ahead girl. When she was 18 months old, she decided it was time for her to go to school. So, when my wife was dropping off our oldest at her class, she decided to go hop into the coat room and start taking her boots off, too. When my wife realized what was happening and explained to Hannah that she couldn't go to school yet, she was heartbroken. Then, she examined the other children and said to her mom, \"I need a pack- pack.\" Since then, this tendency has only increased. She's always up to something. She's very, very bright (terrifyingly smart, actually) and just wants to go and do the next thing. The struggle for her is contentment-accepting the limitations that exist (primarily due to her age-it's tough being not-quite four), and enjoying her present circumstances. She needs to see that while there are lots of exciting adventures to come, we need to appreciate our current circumstances, for God has placed us here at this time for our good.",
    "prayer": "Father, thank you that you establish the times in which we live, and that you know all our days from beginning to end. Please help my daughter to be content in her circumstances and to enjoy the day you've given her even as you prepare her for the next. Amen.",

    "devotion": "I often pray that my daughter would develop a passion for learning and studying God's Word. I also often forget the point of seeking this knowledge. Head knowledge has the potential to do nothing but enlarge the ego and create a false sense of self- righteousness and good standing before God. Paul tells us that the pursuit of wisdom and revelation is indeed a worthy one, yet we do this so that we may know our Father better. The world may occasionally dress us up with accolades and praise for any knowledge we possess, but God looks at the heart. Let us pray that our daughters choose to forego the praise of man in favor of a heart clothed with the longing to know God more deeply.",
    "prayer": "Father, I thank you for the ability we have to expand our knowledge of you and grow in understanding. I pray that you would plant in my daughter a deep desire to seek you and know you. Keep her free from the chains of impressing others and from the vanity that knowledge can create. I pray that learning would lead her to greater worship and give her power to understand your incredible love for her. In Christ's name, I pray, Amen.",

    "passage": "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.\nGenesis 1:27",
    "devotion": "Elisabeth Eliot wrote this 15 years ago, it is even more true today: \"I find myself in the sometimes quite uncomfortable position of having to belabor the obvious, and hold up examples of femininity to women who almost feel apologetic for being feminine or being womanly. I would remind you that femininity is not a curse. It is not even a triviality. It is a gift, a divine gift, to be accepted with both hands, and to thank God for. Because remember, it was His idea...\"\n\nThe world would have our daughters believe their femininity is something for which to apologize. It is not. Let us praise God for giving us the gift of femininity in our homes. Also, let us pray that she might not be embarrassed by her femininity but \"accept it with both hands\" and glorify God through the gift of being female.",

We pray that she will one day be with us in heaven singing praises to a glorious and transcendent God. As parents, the desire to care for our daughters is fused into our DNA. Whatever we can do for them, we want to do. But this is something they must do on their own. They must confess for themselves. They must believe for themselves. We must lift them before our glorious God in prayer that he draw them to himself so that they may indeed believe and confess. And we must trust God to accomplish his will in this, all for his glory alone.",

As hours turn into days, days turn into months, and months turn into years, a parent can become frustrated. \"It has not changed; it will never change,\" we'll say to ourselves in sorrow. In these times, our feelings become a terrible enemy. But we must keep praying and watching as the father in Luke 15 did-waiting for his beloved child to return. Be still and know that he is God and is able to bring her safely home.",

Foggy and fictitious, they wake me and then leave me, heart pounding, in a blackened bedroom with my husband sleeping soundly nearby. A common concern of many women with whom I speak is anxiety, and it appears it becomes increasingly pervasive as we age.

We are constantly tempted to try and satisfy the desires of our hearts with anything and everything other than the only one who can do it, God himself. Yet it is only when we delight in the Lord and orient our hearts toward him that our desires are truly met and truly satisfied. When we commit ourselves to God in Christ through his Spirit, we find the fulfillment we were created to experience. We can only delight in the Lord and commit ourselves to him, however, through his power and help. So let us pray for our daughters, that their hearts would turn toward God, finding their delight in him, committing themselves to him, and having their deepest desires met by him.",
    "prayer": "Father in Heaven, thank you for creating us to find our satisfaction and fulfillment in you, and then allowing us to experience it through Jesus Christ. Help my daughter today to delight in you and your provision of salvation. Keep her from anything that would lessen her delight in you. Fill her with you Spirit that she may desire you and your ways above all else, and find her heart's desires satisfied in you. Help her to commit herself to you and trust you. We thank you that we can find our delight in you, that we can trust you, and that your promises are sure and certain. In Jesus' name, Amen.",

It is equally easy to fall into a pattern of demanding obedience apart from the hope of the gospel. Thus, our children find morality more therapeutic than the gospel. They find their satisfaction in doing right rather than knowing the Righteous One. They develop self- righteousness. We need to remind ourselves that they are imperfect and are only made perfect by Christ. We want to teach them to love the Law of God. We want them to see how Christ's fulfillment of the Law of God as the Word incarnate covers the gap of their imperfections. His grace woos our daughters as it woos her parents.",

May she not exploit your grace; may your grace compel her to loving obedience. Continue to remind me that she is not perfect. As I see her imperfections, help me extend grace out of patience. Remind me of my position as a sinner. In those moments when I want to grit my teeth and bellow an angry response to her defiance, change my disposition. Remind me of how you love. Remind me of how you're patient. Help me to speak tender words to her. Help me to firmly love her.

Culture says, \"Serve yourself.\" It likes kindness so long as it costs you and not them.

Let her soul flow with humility towards you, understanding her sin and brokenness, and that the only way to walk with you is through your Son, Jesus Christ. Lord, keep her from pride so that she may respond to a hostile world in the love and kindness of Christ. Make her soul delight in righteousness so that justice may flow from her. Keep her humble toward you, God, so that in life she may glorify you and not bring shame upon your name. Lead my daughter not into temptation, but deliver her from evil.
